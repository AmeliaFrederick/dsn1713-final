# dsn1713-final

Getting Started
Begin by setting up a new GitHub repository for this project called dsn1713-final. Remember to enable GH pages so that you can view your site live on Github.
Clone your new repository down to your local environment and open your project in VS Code.
You are free to decide how you would like to setup Bootstrap:
CDN: Use Bootstrap’s CDN to include the library via links in your HTML files.
npm install: Alternatively, you can install Bootstrap using npm to have more control over variables.
Requirements:


Page Development:
Develop three pages in total (Home, + 2 additional pages) each based on the designs created in your UX/UI course.
Must include a variety of semantic html elements.
Each page should follow your original design layout closely but take advantage of Bootstrap’s components and grid for responsive adjustments.

Reponsive Design:
Ensure all pages are fully responsive across screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
Use Bootstrap’s grid system and responsive utilities to achieve a fluid layout that adapts to various device sizes.

Bootstrap Components & Utilities:
Incorporate at least three Bootstrap components (ex. navbar, cards, buttons, etc..) to enhance functionality and maintain consistency with your design.
Use Bootstrap’s utilities (ex. spacing, color, and typography utilities) to minimize custom CSS and make your code efficient.

Custom Styling:
Where necessary, add custom CSS to match specific design requirements that may not be achievable with Bootstrap alone.

Additional Library Integration:
Integrate one additional JavaScript or CSS library to enhance your site.
This topic will be covered in week 11 where you will be provided with examples you can use for your project.

Organize html, css and image files in a proper folder structure
